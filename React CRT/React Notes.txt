Virtual DOM in React:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight , in-memory representation of the actual DOM, implemented as a tree of JavaScript objects.

When a React component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree that reflects the updated UI.

React then compares this new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one. This process identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

Only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, a process known as "reconciliation."

This improves performance by reducing the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM and avoiding full-page re-renders.

How Virtual DOM works in React:

Initial Render: React creates a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the real DOM.

State/Prop Update: A new Virtual DOM tree is created based on the updated state or props.

Diffing: React compares the new and previous Virtual DOM trees to find differences.

Reconciliation: Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM, minimizing costly operations.
